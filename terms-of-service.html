    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
        By adding Structura (“the Bot”) to your Discord server, using its commands, 
        or accessing any related services by Skyline Bot Studio (“the Developer”), 
        you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you must remove the Bot immediately.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>
        Structura is a Discord automation system designed to create channels, categories, roles, 
        templates, and server structures through slash commands. Optional premium features 
        may be offered in the future.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. User Data & Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Structura does <strong>not store message content</strong> or forward any data to external servers.
        The Bot only collects and stores data necessary for core operation:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Server ID</li>
        <li>Channel IDs created by the bot</li>
        <li>Role IDs created by the bot</li>
        <li>Template data (server layout backups)</li>
        <li>Command usage logs (success/error)</li>
        <li>User ID for ticket creation or role automation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All data is stored <strong>locally on your server host</strong> (your bot runtime environment) and is 
        never shared with third parties.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. Prohibited Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to not use Structura to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Automate harmful, abusive, or unlawful actions</li>
        <li>Evade Discord moderation systems</li>
        <li>Create malicious or deceptive server structures</li>
        <li>Spam members, roles, or channels</li>
        <li>Access data the bot was not intended to collect</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>5. Bot Uptime & Availability</h2>
    <p>
        Structura is provided “as is”.  
        The Developer does not guarantee:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>100% uptime</li>
        <li>Permanent command availability</li>
        <li>Compatibility with future Discord API changes</li>

    <p>
        You are responsible for monitoring your own bot hosting if self-hosting.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>6. Early Access Testers</h2>
    <p>
        Testers may receive free or early access in exchange for feedback.  
        All testers agree:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To report bugs honestly</li>
        <li>Not to publicly leak features before release</li>
        <li>Not to sell or redistribute the bot</li>
        <li>To use the bot at their own risk during testing</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>7. Premium Features</h2>
    <p>
        Some features may become paid in the future (templates, automation packs, cloud backups, etc.).  
        Premium features are optional and not required to use the basic version.
    </p>

        <li>Accidental deletion caused by user error</li>
        <li>Actions taken by administrators in your server</li>
        <li>Host-related data loss (e.g., local file storage problems)</li>
